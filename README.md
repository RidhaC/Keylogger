## What is a Keylogger?

A keylogger is a tool that records every keystroke made on a keyboard. These logs are often collected without the user's knowledge. Keyloggers are commonly used in cybersecurity training and research but can also be misused for stealing passwords and sensitive information.

Even Microsoft has stated that Windows 10 includes certain telemetry features that can record typing behavior to improve user experience.

## Types of Keyloggers

There are two main categories of keyloggers:

### 1. Software-Based Keyloggers

These are applications that run on a device and monitor keyboard activity. Some advanced software keyloggers can also:

- Capture clipboard data
- Take periodic screenshots
- Log text from windows or applications
- Record browser activity, search queries, and instant messages

### 2. Hardware-Based Keyloggers

These are physical devices connected between the keyboard and computer. Features include:

- Logging from the moment the system powers on
- No need for software installation
- Stealth operation without triggering antivirus alerts
- Storage that can range from a few KB to several TB

## How to Detect and Remove a Keylogger

Detecting a keylogger depends on its complexity:

- Poorly built keyloggers may slow down your system, cause typing delays, or show visual glitches.
- High-quality keyloggers are designed to be stealthy and may not affect system performance at all.

To detect and remove them:

- Use reliable antivirus or anti-malware tools
- Perform regular system scans
- Monitor suspicious files or unexpected system behavior
- Look for software that disguises itself as legitimate applications

Some corporate keyloggers display warnings or consent banners, while others may reinstall themselves even after removal attempts.

## How to Stay Protected

To reduce the risk of keyloggers:

- Keep your operating system, browsers, and software updated
- Use strong, unique passwords for every account
- Avoid opening unknown or suspicious attachments
- Enable real-time antivirus and anti-malware protection
- Be cautious when downloading software or using public/shared systems

Using layered security tools with real-time protection, heuristic analysis, and behavioral detection will help you stay safe from keyloggers and other malware.
